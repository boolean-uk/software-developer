## Intro
When we looked at the Request/Response cycle, we saw that the first request from a browser for a page returned a some text structured with angle brackets (`>` and `<`).

These are known as **tags**. These are part of a Markup language called **HTML** (Hyper Text Markup Language). Itâ€™s not a programming language, since we canâ€™t describe logic with it. Instead, the **purpose of a markup language is to have a uniform notation that describes content and structure**.And thatâ€™s what HTML is for... to describe a pageâ€™s structure and content! In this session we'll look at how the browser renders HTML to display web pages.

## Teacher Demo
Your teacher will demonstrate how to construct an HTML page that mimics the structure of a book using HTML tags taking the following steps:
* Creating a basic HTML document with a single `p` tag
* Opening that document in the browser to see how it is displayed
* Explaning the formatting rules of HTML tags - opening closing tag, self-closing tag, attribute & values, content
* Updating the element to see how the browser renders different tags covering:
    * `p`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `div`, `img`, `hr`, `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `hr`, `a`
* Explain how to properly format HTML to make it readable
* Showing to use HTML comments
* Explain the role of the `html`, `head`, `body` and `title` elements

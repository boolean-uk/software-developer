# Skills Workshop - CSS Introduction
## Learning Objectives
* Explain how a CSS file is included in a HTML page
* Explain and use CSS `Type` selectors
* Explain the structure of a CSS rule
* Create basic CSS rules to modify:
    * Text color
    * Bacgkround color
    * Font size

## Intro
So far we’ve seen how we write HTML and structure our text in the page. By now we already know:
* How to create an HTML page
* How to render elements on a page
* How to organise elements to give some structure to a page

But we’re still not able to change its look, to style it. After all, the web pages we use daily look nothing like the ones we’ve created so far. We need **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** for that! In this session we'll look at how we cna use CSS 

## Teacher Demo
Your teacher will demonstrate using CSS to style an HTML page:
* Including a stylesheet in an HTML file
* Creating a simple CSS using a `Type` selector
* Modifying the rule to change background color, font size, and text color
* Showing how to use Google and MDN to discover new CSS rules

## Student Practice
Practice the skills the teacher has demonstrated by applying some CSS to the profile page you created yesterday. You should:

* Change the color of the headings
* Change the color of the background
* Change the size of the font
* **Challenge #1** Remove the lists’ items markers
* **Challenge #2** Google a different CSS property of the ones mentioned here, and showcase it

Use the provided reference material where required and ask in for help the #support channel if you need it.
